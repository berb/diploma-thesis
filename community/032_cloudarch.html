<h2 id="trad">3.2 Cloud Architectures</h2>

<p>Within the last years, the increasing presence of large-scale architectures has introduced the era of Cloud Computing. </p>

<h3 id="cloud">Cloud Computing</h3>
<p>There is a huge number of different definitions available
towards Cloud Computing. The term "cloud" itself is derived
from the figurative abstraction of the internet represented
as a cloud. The available definitions of Cloud Computing
range from reductions it to be ``the next hype term"
over pragmatic definitions focusing on special aspects to
definitions, that see Cloud Computing as a general paradigm
shift of information architectures, as an <SPAN  CLASS="textit">ACM CTO
Roundtable</SPAN>&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="0_bibliography.html#Creeger2009">Cre09</A>] has shown in 2009.
Of the various features that are attributed to the "cloud",  scalability,
a pay-per-use utility model and virtualization are the minimum common
denominators.

<P>
The key concept of Cloud Computing is the resourcing
of services. These services can be generally differentiated
into three vertical layers:

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>IaaS</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The provision of virtualized hardware, in most cases as
virtual computing instances, is termed IaaS. The particular feature of this
form of cloud service is the ability to change these instances on demand and at
any time. This includes spawning new computing instances, altering existing ones
by resizing or reassigning resources or shutting down unneeded instances
dynamically. Basic working units for IaaS are virtual images, that are
instantiated and deployed in the cloud and executed within virtual machines.
They contain an operating system and additional software implementing the
application. Due to complete virtualization, the physical infrastructure of the
data centers of IaaS providers is totally transparent to their customers.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>PaaS</STRONG></DT>
<DD>PaaS provides an additional level of abstraction by
offering an entire runtime environment for cloud-based applications. PaaS
typically supplies a software stack of dedicated components where applications
can be executed on, but also tools facilitating the development process. The
platform hides all scalability efforts from the developer, thus it appears as
one single system to the user, although it transparently adapts to scale. 
Most of the platforms realize this feature through elaborate monitoring and metering. 
Once an application is uploaded onto the
platform, the system automatically deploys it within the nodes of the data
center of the PaaS. When the application is running under heavy load, new
nodes will be added automatically for execution. If demand declines, spare nodes
will be detached from the application and returned into the pool of available
resources.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>SaaS</STRONG></DT>
<DD>SaaS provides a web-centric supply of applications. Due
to various technological trends, web-based applications mature and become
powerful pieces of software running entirely within the browser of the user. By
replacing traditional desktop applications that run locally, SaaS providers
are able to publish their applications solely in the web.  Cloud architectures
allow them to cope with a huge number of users online. It allows users to access
the applications on demand and they can be charged merely by usage without
having to buy any products or licenses. This reflects the idea to consider the
provision of software <SPAN  CLASS="textit">as a service</SPAN>.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
Referring to the terminology of Cloud Computing, a scalable web application is essentially a SaaS 
that requires appropriate execution/hosting environments (PaaS and/or IaaS). 


<h3 id="providers">PaaS and IaaS Providers</h3>
<p>In the following, we will consider some exemplary hosting providers and outline their service features. </p>

<h4 id="aws">Amazon Web Services</h4>
<p>Amazon was one of the first providers for dedicated, on-demand and pay-per-use <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">web services</a>.
It is currently dominating the multi-tenant Cloud Computing market. Their main product is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)</SPAN>, 
a service providing different virtualized private servers. The provision of virtualized machines in
scalable amounts forms an architectural basis for most of their clients. Instead of growing and maintaining own infrastructure, 
EC2 clients can spin up new machine instances within seconds and thus cope with varying demand.
This traditional IaaS hosting is complemented by a set of other scalable services that represent typical architecture components.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Elastic Block Storage (EBS)</SPAN> provides block-level storage volumes for EC2 instances. <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Simple Storage Service (S3)</SPAN> is a key-value
web-based storage for files. More sophisticated data storage systems available are <SPAN  CLASS="textit">SimpleDB</SPAN>, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">DynamoDB</SPAN> 
and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Relational Database Service (RDS)</SPAN>. The former two services represent non-relational database management systems with a limited
set of features. RDS currently supports MySQL-based and Oracle-based relational databases.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)</SPAN> provides load-balancing functionalities on transport protocol level (e.g. TCP) and application level (e.g. HTTP). 
As a message queue, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Simple Queue Service (SQS)</SPAN> can be used. For complex MapReduce-based computations, Amazon has introduced
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Elastic MapReduce</SPAN>.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">ElastiCache</SPAN> is an in-memory cache system that helps speeding up web applications.
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">CloudFront</SPAN> is a CDN, complementing S3 by replicating items geographically.  
For monitoring purposes, Amazon has come up with <SPAN  CLASS="textit">CloudWatch</SPAN>, a central real-time monitoring web service.

<P>
Besides these services, Amazon has introduced their own PaaS stack, called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Elastic Beanstalk</SPAN>.
It is essentially a bundle of existing services such as EC2, S3 and ELB and allows to deploy and scale Java-based web applications. 
Furthermore, there are additional services that cover business services such as accounting or billing. 

<h4 id="gae">Google App Engine</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://appengine.google.com/">Google App Engine</a> is a PaaS environment for web applications. It currently provides support for Python, Go and several JVM-based languages
such as Java. Applications are hosted and executed in data centers managed by Google. One of its main features is the automatic scaling
of the application. The deployment of the application is transparent for the user, and applications encountering high load will be automatically deployed
to additional machines. 

<P>
Google provides free usage quotas for the App Engine, limiting traffic, bandwidth, number of internal service calls and storage size among others. 
After exceeding these limits, users can decide to add billable resources and are thus getting charged for additional capacities.

<P>
The runtime environment of the application is sandboxed and several language features are restricted. 
For instance, JVM-based applications cannot spawn new threads, use socket connections and access the local file system.
Furthermore, the execution of a request must not exceed a 30 seconds limit. This restrictions are enforced by modified JVMs and altered class libraries.

<P>
Besides an application container, the App Engine provides several services and components as part of the platform. They are accessible through a set of APIs.
We will now have a brief look at the current Java API. 

<P>
The <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Datastore API</SPAN> is the basic storage backend of the App Engine. It is schemaless object datastore, with support for querying 
and atomic transaction execution. Developers can access the datastore using Java Data Objects,  Java Persistence API interfaces or
via a special low-level API. A dedicated API provides support for asynchronous access to the datastore. 
For larger objects, and especially binary resources, the App Engine provides a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Blobstore API</SPAN>. 
For caching purposes, the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Memcache API</SPAN> can be used. Either using a low-level API or the JCache interface. 

<P>
The <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Capabilities API</SPAN> enables programmatical access to scheduled service downtimes and can be used to develop applications 
that prepare for the unavailablity of capabilities automatically.
The <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Multitenancy API</SPAN> provides support for multiple separated instances of an application running in the App Engine. 

<P>
Images can be manipulated using the dedicated <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Images API</SPAN>. The <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Mail API</SPAN> allows the application to send and receive emails.
Similarly, the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">XMPP API</SPAN> allows message exchange based on XMPP. 
The <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Channel API</SPAN> can be used to establish high-level channels with clients over HTTP and then push messages to them. 

<P>
The <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Remote API</SPAN> opens an App Engine application for programmable access using an external Java application.
Other web resources can be accessed using the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">URLFetch API</SPAN>. 

<P>
Thanks to the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Task Queue API</SPAN>, there is some support for tasks decoupled from request handling. Requests can add tasks to a queue,
and workers asynchronously execute the background work.    
The <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Users API</SPAN> provides several means to authenticate users, including Google Accounts and OpenID identifiers.</p>
