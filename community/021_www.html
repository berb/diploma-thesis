<h2 id="www">2.1 The World Wide Web</h2>

<p>The Internet and the WWW have become the backbone of our modern society and
economy. The WWW is a distributed system of interlinked hypermedia
resources in the Internet. It is based on a set of different, related
technologies. We will have a brief look on the most important protocols and
formats in this section, including Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), HTTP and HTML.</p>

<h3 id="uri">Uniform Resource Identifiers</h3>

<p>URI, currently specified in RFC 3986&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="0_bibliography.html#rfc3986">BL05</A>], are strings that are used to reference resources. In terms of
distributed systems, a URI has three distinct roles - naming, addressing,
and identifying resources. We will focus on URI identifying resources in
the WWW, although they can be used for other abstract or physical entities
as well. According to the
specification, a URI consists of five parts: <SPAN  CLASS="textit">scheme</SPAN>,
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">authority</SPAN>, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">path</SPAN>, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">query</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">fragment</SPAN>.
However, only <SPAN  CLASS="textit">scheme</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">path</SPAN> are mandatory, the other parts
are optional.
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Scheme</SPAN> is declaring the type of the URI and thus determines the
meaning of the other parts of the URI.
If used, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">authority</SPAN> points to the responsible authority of the
referenced resource. In case of <TT>http</TT> as scheme, this part becomes
mandatory and contains the host of the web server hosting the resource. It can
optionally contain a port number (80 is implied for <TT>http</TT>) and authentication data (deprecated). 
The mandatory <SPAN  CLASS="textit">path</SPAN> section is used to address the resource within the
scope of the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">scheme</SPAN> (and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">authority</SPAN>). It is often structured
hierarchically. The optional <SPAN  CLASS="textit">query</SPAN> part provides non-hierarchical data
as part of the resource identifier. <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Fragment</SPAN>s can be used to
point to a certain part within the resource. 
The following example is adapted from RFC 3986&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="0_bibliography.html#rfc3986">BL05</A>] and makes use of
all five parts:

<pre>
        http://example.com:8080/over/there?search=test#first
         \_/   \______________/\_________/ \_________/ \__/
          |           |            |            |        |
       scheme     authority       path        query   fragment
</pre>
       
<p>It identifies a web resource (scheme is <TT>http</TT>), that is hosted on the
<TT>example.com</TT> (on port 8080). The resource path is <TT>/over/there</TT>
and the query component contains the key/value pair <TT>search=test</TT>.
Furthermore, the <TT>first</TT> fragment of the resource is referenced.</p>


<h3 id="http">The Hypertext Transfer Protocol</h3>

<p>The HTTP is an application-level protocol that represents the foundation
of communication for the WWW on top of TCP/IP. 
HTTP, as defined in RFC 2616&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="0_bibliography.html#rfc2616">Fie99</A>], is a stateless protocol and
complies with a client/server architecture and a request/response communication model.
Servers host resources that are identified by URI and can be accessed by
clients. The client issues an HTTP request to the server which
in return provides an HTTP response. The communication model limits
the possible message patterns to single request/response cycles that are
always initiated by the client.
Apart from clients and servers, HTTP also describes optional intermediaries, so
called proxies. These components provide additional features such as caching or
filtering. Proxies combine features of a client and a server and are thus
often transparent for the clients and servers in terms of communication.</p>

<p>
HTTP requests and responses have a common structure. Both start with a request
line respectively status line. The next part contains a set of header lines that
include information about the request 
respectively response and about the entity.</p>

<p>The entity is an optional body of an HTTP message that contains
payload such as a representation of the resource. While the first two parts of
an HTTP message are text-based, the entity can be any set of bytes. HTTP
request lines contain a request URI and a method. There are different HTTP methods
that provide different semantics when applied to a resource, as shown in
<a href="#table/1">table 2.1</a>.</p>

<p>We will now have a closer look at two advanced features of HTTP that are
interesting for our later considerations, namely connection handling and 
chunked encoding.</p>

<h4 id="con">HTTP Connection Handling</h4>
<p> 
As already mentioned, HTTP uses TCP/IP as underlying transport protocol. We will
now examine the exact usage of TCP sockets for HTTP requests. The previous
specifications of HTTP have suggested a separate socket connection for each
request/response cycle. Adding the overhead of establishing a TCP
connection for each request leads to poor performance and missing
reusability of existing connections. The non-standard <TT>Connection:
Keep-Alive</TT> header was a temporary workaround, but the current HTTP&nbsp;1.1
specification has addressed this issue in detail. HTTP&nbsp;1.1 introduced
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">persistent connections</SPAN> as default. That is, the underlying TCP
connection of an HTTP request is reused for subsequent HTTP requests.
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Request pipelining</SPAN> further improves throughput of persistent
connections by allowing to dispatch multiple requests, without awaiting
for responses to prior requests. The server then responds
to all incoming request in the same sequential order.
Both mechanisms have improved the
performance and decreased latency problems of web applications. But the
management of multiple open connections and the processing of pipelined requests
has revealed new challenges for web servers as we see in chapter <a href="index.html#chapter/4">4</a>.</p>


<h4 id="chunked">HTTP Chunked Transfer Encoding</h4>
<p>An HTTP message must contain the length of its entity, if any. In HTTP&nbsp;1.1, this is
neccessary for determining the overall length of a message
and detecting the next message of a persistent connection. Sometimes, the exact
length of an entity cannot be determined a priori. This is especially important
for content that is generated dynamically or for entities that are compressed on-the-fly.
Therefore, HTTP provides alternative transfer encodings. When <SPAN  CLASS="textit">chunked
transfer encoding</SPAN> is used, the client or server streams chunks of
the entity sequentially. The length of the next chunk to expect is prepended to the
actual chunk. A chunk length of <SPAN CLASS="MATH">0</SPAN> denotes the end of the entity. This
mechanism allows the transfer of generated entities with arbitrary length.</p>


<h3 id="webformat">Web Formats</h3>
<p>HTTP does not restrict the document formats to be used for entities. However, the core idea of the WWW is based on hypermedia, thus most of the formats are hypermedia-enabled. The single most important format is the HTML and its descendants. </p>

<h4 id="html">Hypertext Markup Language</h4>
<p>HTML&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="0_bibliography.html#Jacobs1999">Jac99</A>] is a markup language derived from the SGML&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="0_bibliography.html#ISO1986">ISO86</A>] and influenced by the XML&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="0_bibliography.html#Bray2008">Bra08</A>]. HTML provides 
a set of elements, properties and rules for describing web pages textually.
A browser parses the HTML document, using its structural semantics for rendering a visual representation for humans. 
HTML supports hypermedia through hyperlinks and interactive forms. Also, media objects such as images can be used in an HTML document. 
The appearance and style of an HTML document can be customized by using CSS&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="0_bibliography.html#Meyer2001">Mey01</A>].
For more dynamic user interfaces and interactive behavior, HTML documents can be enriched with embedded code of scripting languages, such as <SPAN  CLASS="textit">JavaScript</SPAN>&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="0_bibliography.html#ECMAInternational1999">ECM99</A>]. For instance, it can be used to programmatically load new contents in the background, without a complete reload of the page. 
This technique, also known as AJAX, has been one of the keys for more responsive user interfaces. 
It thus enables web applications to resemble interfaces of traditional desktop applications.</p>

<h4 id="html5">HTML5</h4>
<p>
The fifth revision of the HTML standard&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="0_bibliography.html#Hyatt2009">Hya09</A>] introduces several markup improvements (e.g. semantic tags), better multimedia content support,
but most notably a rich set of new APIs. These APIs address various features including client-side storage, offline support, device sensors for context awareness
and improved client-side performance.
The Web Sockets API&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="0_bibliography.html#Hickson2009">Hic09a</A>] complements the traditional HTTP request/response communication pattern
with a low latency, bidirectional, full-duplex socket based on the WebSocket protocol&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="0_bibliography.html#RFC6455">Fet11</A>].
This is especially interesting for real-time web applications.</p>

<h4 id="generic">Generic Formats</h4>
<p>Besides proprietary and customized formats, web services often make use of generic, structured formats such as XML and JSON&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="0_bibliography.html#RFC4627">Cro06</A>].
XML is a comprehensive markup language providing a rich family of related technologies, like validation, transformation or querying.
JSON is one of the leightweight alternatives that focuses solely on the succinct representation of structured data.
While there is an increasing interest in lightweight formats for web services and messages, XML provides still the most extensive
tool set and support.</p>
